# SAT solver

A C++ [SAT solver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem#Algorithms_for_solving_SAT) implementation, based on the [DPLL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPLL_algorithm) algorithm.

This (quite na√Øve) solver is an assignment for the [Logic in Information Technology](http://www.fib.upc.edu/en/estudiar-enginyeria-informatica/assignatures/LI.html) course and is meant to provide us with the basics of SAT solving techniques.
